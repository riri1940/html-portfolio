<h1>Must Watch movies According to Rita</h1>
<h2>The Top Five... Here They are!</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Mufasa</h3>
<p>Whoever thought of creating a story surrounding Mufasa's past and his connection with Scar did a great job. Thumbs up to the producers. It was worth every minute</p>

<h3>Squid Game</h3>
<p>If you are a lover of action movies, then this one's for you.</p>

<h3>Woman King</h3>
<p>The strength and hidden potentials of the African woman portrayed in its fullness. A must watch!</p>

<h3>The Queen's Umbrella</h3>
<p>Set in South Korea. Very engaging, suspense packed. K-drama lovers, this one's particularly for you.</p>

<h3>24</h3>
<p>Jack Bauer is the right guy that keeps you glued to the screen for 24 hours. I'll give it a 5-star.</p>
